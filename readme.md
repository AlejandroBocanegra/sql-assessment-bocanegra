# SQL Assessment

You are tasked with creating an application that stores your grocery list.
As you know, the first step is to think about the data that you will need to
store.

Our grocery list looks like the following:

* milk - 2 gallons
* eggs - 1 dozen
* butter - 12 sticks
* flour - 1 pound
* sour cream - 1 dollop
* apples - 2 bushels
* sugar - 2 pounds
* oj - 3 gallons

__Task 1:__
Write SQL queries that will create a table that stores your
grocery list. There are a few ways to do it, so pick one and defend it.

__Task 2:__
Write the SQL queries that insert the data listed above.

__Task 3:__
Write the SQL queries that find items on your list that have the same units
(i.e. pounds, dollops, etc.)

HINT - Consider what schema would make this easiest to do!

__Task 4:__
Write the SQL queries to capitalize all of the items on your grocery list.
i.e Flour, Sugar, etc.

__Task 5:__
You decide that you are watching your figure. Remove butter and sour cream
from your list.
